Subject: AppSail Deployment - Application Running But Returns "Execution Failed" Error

Hello Zoho Catalyst Support Team,

I am experiencing a persistent issue with my AppSail deployment where the application starts successfully but the AppSail URL returns an "Execution failed. Please check the startup command or port" error.

**Issue Summary:**
- AppSail Service: Hospiico-Backend (ID: 50037434927)
- URL: https://hospiico-backend-50037434927.development.catalystappsail.in
- Error: {"status":"failure","data":{"message":"Execution failed. Please check the startup command or port.","error_code":"INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR"}}
- Platform: JavaSE, Java 17
- Project: HospiiCo

**What I've Confirmed (Application is Working):**
1. ✅ Application logs show successful startup on port 9000:
   - "Tomcat initialized with port 9000 (http)"
   - "HikariPool-1 - Start completed" (database connection successful)
   - Spring Boot application initializes completely

2. ✅ Port configuration is correct:
   - app-config.json: "port": 9000
   - Console Configuration: Port 9000
   - Application startup: java -Dserver.port=9000 -jar target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

3. ✅ Health endpoints exist and are accessible:
   - Root endpoint: GET / returns {"status":"UP","service":"Hospico Hospital Booking API"}
   - Health check: GET /api/health returns {"status":"UP","message":"Service is running"}
   - Spring Security temporarily disabled (all requests permitAll) to rule out authentication blocking

4. ✅ Build completes successfully:
   - JAR file: backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   - Maven build: BUILD SUCCESS
   - No compilation errors

**Configuration Details:**

app-config.json:
```json
{
    "command": "java -Dserver.port=9000 -jar target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar",
    "build_path": "backend",
    "stack": "java17",
    "port": 9000,
    "health_check_path": "/api/health",
    "memory": 1024,
    "platform": "javase"
}
```

catalyst.json:
```json
{
  "appsail": [
    {
      "source": ".",
      "name": "Hospiico-Backend"
    }
  ]
}
```

Console Startup Command:
java -Dserver.port=9000 -jar target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

**What I've Tried:**
1. Verified port 9000 configuration in all files (application.yml, app-config.json, console)
2. Added explicit -Dserver.port=9000 JVM argument
3. Increased memory allocation from 256MB to 1024MB
4. Temporarily disabled Spring Security to eliminate authentication blocking
5. Ensured root endpoint "/" is publicly accessible
6. Added health_check_path configuration
7. Verified startup command matches console and app-config.json
8. Multiple redeployments via Catalyst CLI (catalyst deploy)

**Environment Variables Set:**
- DB_URL: PostgreSQL database on Render (external, connection verified in logs)
- DB_USER: hospital_user
- DB_PASSWORD: [configured]
- GROQ_API_KEY: [configured]

**The Problem:**
Despite the application logs confirming that:
- The application starts successfully
- Tomcat binds to port 9000
- Database connections are established
- All endpoints are defined and accessible

The AppSail URL consistently returns "Execution failed" error, suggesting the AppSail proxy/load balancer cannot reach the application.

**What I Need:**
1. Confirmation that AppSail's internal health check probe can reach applications on port 9000
2. Verification of any additional AppSail configuration required for JavaSE platform
3. Check if there are any console-side overrides or cached configurations preventing proper routing
4. Guidance on whether X_ZOHO_CATALYST_LISTEN_PORT environment variable needs to be explicitly set
5. Any AppSail infrastructure logs showing why the health check is failing

**Additional Context:**
This is a Spring Boot 3.4.5 application previously deployed successfully on Render.com. I am migrating to Zoho Catalyst AppSail following your earlier guidance about port 9000 requirement (from support ticket reference X_ZOHO_CATALYST_LISTEN_PORT).

The application code is working correctly - this appears to be an AppSail infrastructure/routing configuration issue rather than an application issue.

Could you please investigate the AppSail service configuration and advise what additional steps are needed to establish proper routing between the AppSail URL and the running application?

Thank you for your assistance.
